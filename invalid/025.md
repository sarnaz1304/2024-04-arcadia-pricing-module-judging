# Restricted Aeroguage admin could cause core functionalities in protocol to be unavailable


## Summary
Restricted Aeroguage admin could cause core functionalities in protocol to be Dos'd 

## Vulnerability Detail

Take a look at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-arcadia-pricing-module/blob/54832626b806dcb72e250935fc193acb95e0cf8a/accounts-v2/src/asset-modules/Aerodrome-Finance/StakedAerodromeAM.sol#L88-L100

```solidity
    function _stakeAndClaim(address asset, uint256 amount) internal override {
        address gauge = assetToGauge[asset];

        // Claim rewards
        IAeroGauge(gauge).getReward(address(this));

        // Stake asset
        ERC20(asset).approve(gauge, amount);
        IAeroGauge(gauge).deposit(amount);
    }

```

Now consider this section https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-arcadia-pricing-module/blob/54832626b806dcb72e250935fc193acb95e0cf8a/README.md#L40-L44

### Q: Are the admins of the protocols your contracts integrate with (if any) TRUSTED or RESTRICTED? If these integrations are trusted, should auditors also assume they are always responsive, for example, are oracles trusted to provide non-stale information, or VRF providers to respond within a designated timeframe?

(...)
Gauge.sol:

- Owner should ensure the balance of reward token of the contract is sufficient.
- Worst case anyone can top up the balance if owner is non-responsive
- Apart from the mentioned top-up issue RESTRICTED
  (...)
```

Evidently, we can see that asides top-up issue the Guage.sol admin is restricted and not trusted, navigating to the integrated Guage.sol contract here https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/contracts/blob/b934e7ae398ea6c251a4d5af2119776c06f1f23d/contracts/gauges/Gauge.sol

```solidity
    /// @inheritdoc IGauge
    function deposit(uint256 _amount) external {
        _depositFor(_amount, _msgSender());
    }

    /// @inheritdoc IGauge
    function deposit(uint256 _amount, address _recipient) external {
        _depositFor(_amount, _recipient);
    }

    function _depositFor(uint256 _amount, address _recipient) internal nonReentrant {
        if (_amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
        if (!IVoter(voter).isAlive(address(this))) revert NotAlive();

        address sender = _msgSender();
        _updateRewards(_recipient);

        IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransferFrom(sender, address(this), _amount);
        totalSupply += _amount;
        balanceOf[_recipient] += _amount;

        emit Deposit(sender, _recipient, _amount);
    }
```

We can see that whenever depositing, the attempt queries to check if the guage has been killed or not, i.e `  if (!IVoter(voter).isAlive(address(this))) revert NotAlive();` , considering the[ guage can be killed](https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/contracts/blob/b934e7ae398ea6c251a4d5af2119776c06f1f23d/contracts/Voter.sol#L381-L392) by the admin, all attempts at staking and claiming  via the `StakingAm.sol` would now fail, keep in mind that this function is essentially used whenever minting a new position or increasing liquidity.

## Impact

RESTRICTED external admins can break core functionality in protocol, since staking/claiming/minting and increasing liquidity attempts would always encounter a DOS.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that the protocol team and its users are aware of the risks of such an event and develop a contingency plan to manage it!
