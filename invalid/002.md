# Precision Loss in Trusted Reserve Calculations

## Summary
Potential Loss of Precision in Financial Calculations due to Fixed-Point Arithmetic


## Vulnerability Detail
The functions **_getTrustedReservesStable** and **_getTrustedReservesVolatile** calculate trusted reserves using complex mathematical operations that are susceptible to precision loss due to fixed-point arithmetic limitations. The use of multiplication, division, and square root operations on token reserves and price rates could lead to significant rounding errors, impacting financial calculations.

This code uses mulDiv for multiplying two values and then dividing by a third, which is a typical pattern to prevent overflow but does not inherently solve precision loss when dealing with decimals.



## Impact
Precision loss in these calculations could lead to incorrect valuation of pools, which in turn could affect liquidity positions, slippage, and ultimately user investments. An attacker could potentially exploit these inaccuracies to manipulate market conditions, leading to arbitrage opportunities at the expense of other users.

For more explanation

```solidity
trustedReserve0 = FixedPointMathLib.sqrt(
    FullMath.mulDiv(rateUnderlyingAssetsToUsd[1].assetValue, k, rateUnderlyingAssetsToUsd[0].assetValue)
);

uint256 a = x.mulDivDown(y, 1e18); // Potential precision loss here
uint256 b = (x * x + y * y) / 1e18;
k = a * b; // Further compounded precision issues

```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement higher precision arithmetic operations where possible, or include mechanisms to estimate and mitigate rounding errors. Use libraries or techniques that are designed for financial calculations that require high precision to minimize valuation errors.

**1. Use of Higher Precision Arithmetic**
For Solidity, handling high-precision arithmetic operations securely and accurately often involves using specialized libraries. One such library is the ABDK Math 64.64 library, which provides functions to work with numbers in fixed-point binary notation.

You could incorporate this library to handle complex operations like square roots or divisions with higher precision. Hereâ€™s how you could adjust the calculation:

First, add the ABDK Math 64.64 library to your project:

`bash
npm install ABDKMathQuad
`

Then, import and use it in your contract:

```solidity
import "ABDKMath64x64.sol";

function getTrustedReservesVolatile(address pool, AssetValueAndRiskFactors[] memory rateUnderlyingAssetsToUsd)
    internal view returns (uint256 trustedReserve0, uint256 trustedReserve1)
{
    (uint256 reserve0, uint256 reserve1,) = IAeroPool(pool).getReserves();
    uint256 k = reserve0.mul(reserve1); // Calculate invariant

    int128 term1 = ABDKMath64x64.divu(rateUnderlyingAssetsToUsd[1].assetValue, rateUnderlyingAssetsToUsd[0].assetValue);
    int128 sqrtValue = ABDKMath64x64.sqrt(
        ABDKMath64x64.divu(k, ABDKMath64x64.mulu(term1, term1))
    );
    trustedReserve0 = ABDKMath64x64.toUInt(
        ABDKMath64x64.mul(sqrtValue, ABDKMath64x64.fromUInt(reserve0))
    );
    
    trustedReserve1 = FullMath.mulDiv(
        trustedReserve0, rateUnderlyingAssetsToUsd[0].assetValue, rateUnderlyingAssetsToUsd[1].assetValue
    );
}

```
**2. Implement Error Bounds Checking**
To ensure that results are within acceptable bounds, implement checks after each critical operation to ensure that no unexpected behavior occurs due to precision errors. If a calculation exceeds expected bounds, the contract could revert or take corrective action.

**3. Thorough Testing and Validation**
Thoroughly test the new implementation against a range of possible values, especially edge cases that might cause extreme ratios or small denominators. Utilize testing frameworks like Hardhat or Truffle along with property-based testing libraries to automate this testing.
