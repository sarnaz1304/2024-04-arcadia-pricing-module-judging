# Lack of Reentrancy Guards

## Summary
Potential Reentrancy Vulnerabilities in Staking Operations


## Vulnerability Detail
The functions **_stakeAndClaim** and **_withdrawAndClaim** involve external calls to **IAeroGauge** which could potentially be exploited via reentrancy attacks. After the external call, if the external contract calls back into any of the public or external functions of **StakedAerodromeAM**, it might manipulate the state in an unexpected way.

To illustrate a potential reentrancy attack exploiting the vulnerability identified in the _stakeAndClaim method of the StakedAerodromeAM contract, let's look at how the reentrancy could occur. In the provided method, the contract interacts with an external contract (IAeroGauge), which could be maliciously crafted or exploited if it's controllable by an attacker.

**Vulnerable Function**
The _stakeAndClaim function in the contract makes multiple external calls which can be points of reentrancy:

```solidity
function _stakeAndClaim(address asset, uint256 amount) internal override {
    address gauge = assetToGauge[asset];

    // External call to claim rewards
    IAeroGauge(gauge).getReward(address(this));

    // Approval to the gauge to allow token transfers
    ERC20(asset).approve(gauge, amount);

    // External call to deposit tokens which can be the point of reentrancy
    IAeroGauge(gauge).deposit(amount);
}

```

**Attack Scenario**
Imagine that the **IAeroGauge** contract is either malicious or has a vulnerability that allows it to call back into the **StakedAerodromeAM** contract during the execution of **deposit(amount)**. Here’s how an attack might proceed:

1. **Initial Setup**: The attacker deploys a malicious **IAeroGauge** contract and manages to register it in the system so that it’s used by the **StakedAerodromeAM**.
2. . **Triggering Reentrancy**: The attacker calls a function that leads to **_stakeAndClaim** being executed. This could be through direct interaction if public/external or through another function that eventually calls **_stakeAndClaim**.
3. **Exploiting Reentrancy**:

- The **_stakeAndClaim** function first claims rewards, which is benign.
- The function then approves the malicious **IAeroGauge** to transfer the tokens.
- During the **deposit(amount)** call, the malicious **IAeroGauge** makes a reentrant call back into **StakedAerodromeAM**—possibly into another function that could alter state or execute another deposit/withdrawal, manipulating balances or duplicating rewards.

4. **Manipulation**: During the reentrant call, the state of **StakedAerodromeAM** might not be prepared to handle another invocation, leading to potential double spends, incorrect accounting of tokens, or other unintended effects.


**Exploit Code Example**
Bellow a simplified Solidity code snippet simulating the malicious gauge behavior:

```solidity
contract MaliciousGauge {
    StakedAerodromeAM public victim;
    address public attacker;

    constructor(address _victim) {
        victim = StakedAerodromeAM(_victim);
        attacker = msg.sender;
    }

    function deposit(uint256 amount) public {
        // Simulate reentrant attack during the deposit call
        victim.withdrawAndClaim(someAsset, someAmount);  // Assume someAsset and someAmount are valid

        // Other malicious activities here
    }

    function getReward(address) public {
        // Potentially other malicious activities
    }
}
```


## Impact
An attacker could potentially exploit the reentrancy to manipulate the staking logic, resulting in loss or theft of funds.

```solidity
function _stakeAndClaim(address asset, uint256 amount) internal override {
    address gauge = assetToGauge[asset];
    IAeroGauge(gauge).getReward(address(this));  // External call
    ERC20(asset).approve(gauge, amount);         // State changes after external call
    IAeroGauge(gauge).deposit(amount);           // Another external call
}

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a reentrancy guard by using the **nonReentrant** modifier from the OpenZeppelin's **ReentrancyGuard** contract. This modifier should be applied to all public and external functions that make external calls and then perform state changes.

**For Improvement**

Use of Reentrancy Guard: Apply a reentrancy guard to all functions making external calls followed by state changes.

Validate State Changes: Ensure state changes occur before external calls when possible, or validate state after external calls if before is not possible.
Enhanced Error Handling: Consider providing more descriptive errors for each revert condition, which could aid debugging and operational transparency.

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract StakedAerodromeAM is StakingAM, ReentrancyGuard {
    // Use nonReentrant on functions that involve external calls
    function _stakeAndClaim(address asset, uint256 amount) internal override nonReentrant {
        ...
    }
}

```

Regular Audits: Given the dependencies on external contracts, regular audits and monitoring of those contracts' security are recommended.
