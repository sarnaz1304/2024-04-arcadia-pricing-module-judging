# Revert on Non-Zero to Non-Zero Approval for USDT

## Summary

USDT, when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value to a non-zero value, will revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

The README says at [L17-L20](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-arcadia-pricing-module/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L17-L20):
> We also want to receive issues regarding minimal implementations of ERC20 Tokens, which besides a standard implementation have one of the following "weird behaviours":
...
> Revert on Non-Zero to Non-Zero Approval

USDT falls under the category of such tokens and the following function will revert after the first stake:

- [StakedAerodromeAM.sol#L95](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-arcadia-pricing-module/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/asset-modules/Aerodrome-Finance/StakedAerodromeAM.sol#L95)
```solidity
File: StakedAerodromeAM.sol
88:     function _stakeAndClaim(address asset, uint256 amount) internal override {
89:         address gauge = assetToGauge[asset];
90: 
91:         // Claim rewards
92:         IAeroGauge(gauge).getReward(address(this));
93: 
94:         // Stake asset
95:         ERC20(asset).approve(gauge, amount); //@audit will revert for USDT 
96:         IAeroGauge(gauge).deposit(amount);
97:     }
```

## Impact

USDT cannot be staked.

Impact and token in scope. 

Medium Severity.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

As Solmate is used here, there isn't an immediately available function (replacing with `safeApprove()` will also revert)
Therefore, I suggest simply approving 0 first:
```diff
File: StakedAerodromeAM.sol
88:     function _stakeAndClaim(address asset, uint256 amount) internal override {
89:         address gauge = assetToGauge[asset];
90: 
91:         // Claim rewards
92:         IAeroGauge(gauge).getReward(address(this));
93: 
94:         // Stake asset
+ 95:         ERC20(asset).approve(gauge, 0);  
95:         ERC20(asset).approve(gauge, amount); 
96:         IAeroGauge(gauge).deposit(amount);
97:     }
```
