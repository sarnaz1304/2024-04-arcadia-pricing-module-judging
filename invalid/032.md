# Underflow could happened when calculating Uniswap V3 position's fee growth and can cause operations to revert

## Summary
When operations need to calculate Uniswap V3 position's fee growth, it used similar function implemented by [uniswap v3](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-arcadia-pricing-module/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/asset-modules/Slipstream/SlipstreamAM.sol#L364C14-L364C33). However, according to this known issue : https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/issues/573. The contract is implicitly relies on underflow/overflow when calculating the fee growth, if underflow is prevented, some operations that rely on fee growth will revert.
## Vulnerability Detail
It can be observed that current implementation of getFeeGrowthInside not allow underflow/overflow to happen when calculating feeGrowthInside0X128 and feeGrowthInside1X128, because the contract used solidity 0.8.23.
  function _getFeeGrowthInside(address token0, address token1, int24 tickSpacing, int24 tickLower, int24 tickUpper)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 feeGrowthInside0X128, uint256 feeGrowthInside1X128)
    {
        ICLPool pool = ICLPool(PoolAddress.computeAddress(CL_FACTORY, token0, token1, tickSpacing));

        // To calculate the pending fees, the current tick has to be used, even if the pool would be unbalanced.
        (, int24 tickCurrent,,,,) = pool.slot0();
        (,,, uint256 lowerFeeGrowthOutside0X128, uint256 lowerFeeGrowthOutside1X128,,,,,) = pool.ticks(tickLower);
        (,,, uint256 upperFeeGrowthOutside0X128, uint256 upperFeeGrowthOutside1X128,,,,,) = pool.ticks(tickUpper);

        // Calculate the fee growth inside of the Liquidity Range since the last time the position was updated.
        // feeGrowthInside can overflow (without reverting), as is the case in the Slipstream fee calculations.
        unchecked {
            if (tickCurrent < tickLower) {
                feeGrowthInside0X128 = lowerFeeGrowthOutside0X128 - upperFeeGrowthOutside0X128;
                feeGrowthInside1X128 = lowerFeeGrowthOutside1X128 - upperFeeGrowthOutside1X128;
            } else if (tickCurrent < tickUpper) {
                feeGrowthInside0X128 =
                    pool.feeGrowthGlobal0X128() - lowerFeeGrowthOutside0X128 - upperFeeGrowthOutside0X128;
                feeGrowthInside1X128 =
                    pool.feeGrowthGlobal1X128() - lowerFeeGrowthOutside1X128 - upperFeeGrowthOutside1X128;
            } else {
                feeGrowthInside0X128 = upperFeeGrowthOutside0X128 - lowerFeeGrowthOutside0X128;
                feeGrowthInside1X128 = upperFeeGrowthOutside1X128 - lowerFeeGrowthOutside1X128;
            }
        }
    }
This could impact crucial operation that rely on this call, such as liquidation, could revert unexpectedly. This behavior is quite often especially for pools that use lower fee.

## Recommendation
Use unchecked when calculating feeGrowthInside0X128 and feeGrowthInside1X128.
