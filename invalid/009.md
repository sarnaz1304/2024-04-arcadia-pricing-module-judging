# Unauthorized State Manipulation

## Summary
Insecure Management of Asset State Changes

## Vulnerability Detail
The **addAsset** function updates the **assetState** to reflect the addition of new assets to the contract. However, the contract does not explicitly restrict who can call this function. This absence of access control could potentially allow any external actor to add assets if they satisfy the basic checks performed by the function (such as gauge validity and registry allowance). This oversight may lead to unauthorized or unintended asset registrations.

## Impact
If unauthorized users can add assets, this could disrupt the normal operation of the contract by cluttering it with unauthorized or unwanted assets. It might also be used in a spam attack to deplete gas from legitimate operations, or more critically, it could introduce vulnerabilities through the addition of maliciously designed gauges or pools.

code precision

```solidity
function addAsset(address gauge) external {
    if (AERO_VOTER.isGauge(gauge) != true) revert GaugeNotValid();
    address pool = IAeroGauge(gauge).stakingToken();
    if (!IRegistry(REGISTRY).isAllowed(pool, 0)) revert PoolNotAllowed();
    if (assetState[pool].allowed) revert AssetAlreadySet();
    if (IAeroGauge(gauge).rewardToken() != address(REWARD_TOKEN)) revert RewardTokenNotValid();

    assetToGauge[pool] = gauge;
    _addAsset(pool);
}
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability:

1. Implement Access Control: Introduce access control mechanisms such as using OpenZeppelin’s Ownable or AccessControl contracts to restrict the addAsset function (and potentially other state-modifying functions) to only be callable by contract administrators or other authorized entities.
2. Use Role-Based Permissions: For enhanced flexibility, consider implementing role-based permissions that allow different levels of access for different actions or parts of the contract. This would be especially useful in a decentralized setup where different stakeholders might have governance roles.
3. Audit and Test Thoroughly: After implementing the access controls, conduct thorough testing and audits to ensure that no unauthorized access is possible and that the controls do not inadvertently block legitimate operations.

**Code Example with Access Control**
Here’s how you might modify the **addAsset** function to include owner-only access control using OpenZeppelin's **Ownable**:

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract StakedAerodromeAM is StakingAM, Ownable {
    // Existing code...

    function addAsset(address gauge) external onlyOwner {
        if (AERO_VOTER.isGauge(gauge) != true) revert GaugeNotValid();
        address pool = IAeroGauge(gauge).stakingToken();
        if (!IRegistry(REGISTRY).isAllowed(pool, 0)) revert PoolNotAllowed();
        if (assetState[pool].allowed) revert AssetAlreadySet();
        if (IAeroGauge(gauge).rewardToken() != address(REWARD_TOKEN)) revert RewardTokenNotValid();

        assetToGauge[pool] = gauge;
        _addAsset(pool);
    }
}
```
**Further Considerations**
Ensure that the introduction of access controls is communicated transparently to all users and stakeholders. Regularly review and update these controls in response to changes in the contract’s operational environment or governance structure to maintain security and functionality.
