# Inadequate Reward Token Validation

## Summary
Insufficient Validation for Reward Token Consistency

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract assumes that the reward token associated with each gauge will always be the same as the one specified at the time of contract deployment (denoted as **REWARD_TOKEN**). During the addition of a new asset with **addAsset**, there is a check to ensure that the gauge's reward token matches the **REWARD_TOKEN**. However, there is no mechanism to ensure that this token remains consistent post the initial check, nor is there an ongoing validation mechanism for subsequent operations involving reward tokens.

## Impact
If a gauge's reward token is changed post-addition (assuming the gauge allows for such changes, which can be common in upgradable contracts or those governed by DAOs), it could lead to scenarios where the contract interacts with an unexpected token. This might lead to issues such as failed transactions, incorrect reward claims, or unintended interactions with unvetted tokens, potentially leading to loss of funds or unexpected token transfers.

Code precision

```solidity
function addAsset(address gauge) external {
    if (AERO_VOTER.isGauge(gauge) != true) revert GaugeNotValid();

    address pool = IAeroGauge(gauge).stakingToken();
    if (!IRegistry(REGISTRY).isAllowed(pool, 0)) revert PoolNotAllowed();
    if (assetState[pool].allowed) revert AssetAlreadySet();

    if (IAeroGauge(gauge).rewardToken() != address(REWARD_TOKEN)) revert RewardTokenNotValid();

    assetToGauge[pool] = gauge;
    _addAsset(pool);
}
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, the contract should incorporate a mechanism to validate the reward token each time it interacts with a gauge, especially before critical operations such as claiming rewards. This could be implemented by adding a function to verify the reward token immediately before any reward claim or staking operation.

Here's how the function could be adjusted to include this validation:

```solidity
function validateRewardToken(address gauge) internal view {
    if (IAeroGauge(gauge).rewardToken() != address(REWARD_TOKEN)) {
        revert RewardTokenNotValid();
    }
}

function _claimReward(address asset) internal override {
    address gauge = assetToGauge[asset];
    validateRewardToken(gauge);  // Validate reward token before claiming rewards
    IAeroGauge(gauge).getReward(address(this));
}

function _stakeAndClaim(address asset, uint256 amount) internal override {
    address gauge = assetToGauge[asset];
    validateRewardToken(gauge);  // Validate reward token before staking
    ERC20(asset).approve(gauge, amount);
    IAeroGauge(gauge).deposit(amount);
}

```
**Further Considerations**
This enhancement ensures that the contract interacts with the intended token and mitigates the risks associated with token inconsistencies due to changes in the external gauge's configuration. Furthermore, comprehensive monitoring and additional safeguards should be implemented to handle scenarios where the gauge's reward token may change, including possibly pausing operations or alerting administrators to take corrective action.
