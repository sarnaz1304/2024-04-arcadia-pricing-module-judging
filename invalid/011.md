# Fee Calculation Manipulation in WrappedAerodromeAM

## Summary
Potential for manipulating fee calculations through state-dependent variables without adequate locking or validation mechanisms.

## Vulnerability Detail

The **WrappedAerodromeAM** contract is designed to wrap liquidity from an Aerodrome Finance pool into ERC721 tokens and manage the distribution of fees to these token holders. The vulnerability arises from the method in which fee distributions are calculated and applied. Specifically, the contract updates fee per liquidity metrics based on total pool liquidity (**totalWrapped**) that can be manipulated by strategic deposits or withdrawals around the time fees are distributed. This state dependency, without adequate locking or verification, allows an attacker to artificially affect the fee per liquidity metrics to their advantage.

## Impact
Exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to claim a larger share of fees than their fair contribution to the pool liquidity. This can lead to a loss of funds for other participants, undermine trust in the platform, and skew the intended economic incentives of the liquidity pool.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implementation of Locking Mechanisms: Introduce mutex or similar locking mechanisms during fee calculation and distribution phases to prevent state changes that could affect these calculations.
Use of Snapshots: Adopt snapshot mechanisms for critical state variables like totalWrapped during transactions that involve fee calculations. This ensures that calculations are based on consistent and unmanipulated data.
Enhanced State Validation: Implement additional checks to validate state integrity before and after critical operations, ensuring that no unexpected changes have occurred.
Regular Security Audits: Conduct frequent and thorough security audits focusing on state-dependent functionalities and their interactions, especially those involving financial calculations and distributions.
**Further Steps**
Monitoring and Alerts: Set up monitoring tools to detect unusual patterns of deposits and withdrawals that may indicate attempts to exploit this vulnerability.
Community and User Education: Educate users and developers about the potential risks associated with liquidity provision and fee claims, and encourage responsible disclosure of any observed suspicious activities.
