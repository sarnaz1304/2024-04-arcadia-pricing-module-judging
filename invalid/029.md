# Position minting and liquidity increment will be dossed when Aerodome gauges are killed

## Summary
The protcol integrates with Aerodrome gauges to mint and increase liquidity positions. These core functionalities will be dossed if gauge admins kill gauge.

## Vulnerability Detail

As per contest readme, the admins of the protocols integrated with are considered "RESTRICTED" (apart from the given caveats). This means that any issue related to Aerodrome's admin action that could Arcadia protocol/users will be considered valid in this audit contest.

> Are the admins of the protocols your contracts integrate with (if any) TRUSTED or RESTRICTED? If these integrations are trusted, should auditors also assume they are always responsive, for example, are oracles trusted to provide non-stale information, or VRF providers to respond within a designated timeframe?

> The protocols we integrate with are:

...
> Gauge.sol:

> Owner should ensure the balance of reward token of the contract is sufficient.
> Worst case anyone can top up the balance if owner is non-responsive
> Apart from the mentioned top-up issue RESTRICTED

`StakedAerodromeAM` integrates with Aerodrome gauge and to stake assets into the pool before minting and increasing liquidity positons for the users. The Aerodrome voter admin has the ability to kill the gauges while seizing out the rewards accumulated by the gauge during the time period. 

```solidity
    function killGauge(address _gauge) external {
        if (_msgSender() != emergencyCouncil) revert NotEmergencyCouncil();
        if (!isAlive[_gauge]) revert GaugeAlreadyKilled();
        // Return claimable back to minter
        uint256 _claimable = claimable[_gauge];
        if (_claimable > 0) {
            IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransfer(minter, _claimable);
            delete claimable[_gauge];
        }
        isAlive[_gauge] = false;
        emit GaugeKilled(_gauge);
    }
```

When the gauge is paused, deposits and increasing liquidity will be dossed because the [`mint`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-arcadia-pricing-module/blob/54832626b806dcb72e250935fc193acb95e0cf8a/accounts-v2/src/asset-modules/abstracts/AbstractStakingAM.sol#L318) and [`increaseLiquidity`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-arcadia-pricing-module/blob/54832626b806dcb72e250935fc193acb95e0cf8a/accounts-v2/src/asset-modules/abstracts/AbstractStakingAM.sol#L355) function makes calls to the [`_stakeAndClaim`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-arcadia-pricing-module/blob/54832626b806dcb72e250935fc193acb95e0cf8a/accounts-v2/src/asset-modules/Aerodrome-Finance/StakedAerodromeAM.sol#L96) function in the StakedAerodromeAM contract which deposits into Aerodrome gauge. Aerodrome gauges [revert](https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/contracts/blob/b934e7ae398ea6c251a4d5af2119776c06f1f23d/contracts/gauges/Gauge.sol#L157) when killed.
## Impact
AeroPool gauges can be killed, dossing protocol functionalities of [minting](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-arcadia-pricing-module/blob/54832626b806dcb72e250935fc193acb95e0cf8a/accounts-v2/src/asset-modules/abstracts/AbstractStakingAM.sol#L289C1-L324C6) and [adding](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-arcadia-pricing-module/blob/54832626b806dcb72e250935fc193acb95e0cf8a/accounts-v2/src/asset-modules/abstracts/AbstractStakingAM.sol#L331) liquidity to positions.
