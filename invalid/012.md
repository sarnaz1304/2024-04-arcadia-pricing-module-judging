# Insufficient Validation of Asset Registration in SlipstreamAM

## Summary

The **SlipstreamAM** contract inadequately validates liquidity position data during the registration process, potentially allowing incorrect or manipulated data to influence the systemâ€™s asset management and risk assessments.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract relies on data from the **NonfungiblePositionManager** for registering new liquidity positions. Insufficient validation checks on this data (such as liquidity amounts and token addresses) may allow an attacker to register assets with inflated or incorrect values, potentially impacting financial operations and risk calculations.

## Impact

An attacker can manipulate liquidity data or token addresses before or during the registration process to misrepresent the value or characteristics of a liquidity position. This could enable them to use overvalued assets as collateral, leading to disproportionate credit issuance or financial exposure.

## Code Snippet

code precision 

```solidity
function _addAsset(uint256 assetId) internal {
    if (assetId > type(uint96).max) revert InvalidId();
    (,, address token0, address token1,,,, uint128 liquidity,,,,) = NON_FUNGIBLE_POSITION_MANAGER.positions(assetId);
    if (liquidity == 0) revert ZeroLiquidity();
    assetToLiquidity[assetId] = liquidity;
}
```
**Exploitation Mechanism**

1. **Data Manipulation**: Prior to calling **_addAsset**, an attacker manipulates the liquidity or token data returned by **positions()** in the **NonfungiblePositionManager**.
2. **Timing Attack:** The attacker times their transactions to coincide with volatile market conditions or operational updates to alter the state read by **SlipstreamAM**.
3. **Reentrancy/Callbacks:** Although less likely, if possible, the attacker uses reentrancy or token transfer hooks to alter state during the registration process.

**Example Scenario**

- The attacker prepares a normal-looking liquidity position and manipulates the market to inflate its value temporarily.
- They register the position while its value is inflated, obtaining higher credit or better terms based on this value.
- After securing the benefits, they revert the market conditions to normal, leaving the system with overvalued collateral.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. **Enhanced Validation:** Implement thorough data integrity checks before registering assets, including historical data verification.
2. **Monitoring and Alerts:** Set up systems to monitor and alert on unusual activities or significant changes during asset registration.
3. **Limitations and Reversions:** Introduce limits on asset registration under certain conditions and mechanisms to revert transactions if post-checks reveal discrepancies.

**Further Steps**
**Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular and comprehensive audits to ensure the system accurately handles external data.
**Community Engagement:** Engage with the community to monitor and report potential vulnerabilities or suspicious activities around asset registration.
