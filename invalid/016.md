# Unsafe use of `approve()` with casts to `ERC20`

## Summary

Tokens that do not have a return value will not work as stake assets

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens do not implement the ERC20 standard properly but are still accepted by most code that accepts ERC20 tokens.  For example Tether (USDT)'s `approve()` on L1 does [not](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code#L199) return a boolean as the specification requires, and instead has no return value. When these sorts of tokens are cast to `ERC20`, their [function signatures](https://medium.com/coinmonks/missing-return-value-bug-at-least-130-tokens-affected-d67bf08521ca) do not match and therefore the calls made, revert (see [this](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/2b00a32e8f0559e8f386ea4f1800abc5) link for a test case for `transfer()` rather than for `approve()`). The number of affected tokens is higher than one would expect, due to the fact that at one point OpenZeppelin was using the incorrect signatures in its published interface.

## Impact

While this project is on Base where USDT does not have this issue, the README clearly asks for cases where these sorts of tokens will cause problems:
```markdown
We also want to receive issues regarding minimal implementations of ERC20 Tokens, which besides a standard implementation have one of the following "weird behaviours":
...
- **non-bool returning tokens**
```

The project also asks for future integration issues:
```markdown
### Q: Should potential issues, like broken assumptions about function behavior, be reported if they could pose risks in future integrations, even if they might not be an issue in the context of the scope? If yes, can you elaborate on properties/invariants that should hold?
Yes.
```

Such token's won't work with the protocol as stake assets, so the gauge won't be able get any deposits and calls to [`mint()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-arcadia-pricing-module/blob/54832626b806dcb72e250935fc193acb95e0cf8a/accounts-v2/src/asset-modules/abstracts/AbstractStakingAM.sol#L308-L328) and `increaseLiquidity()` on the Asset Module will fail.


## Code Snippet

```solidity
// File: src/asset-modules/Aerodrome-Finance/StakedAerodromeAM.sol : StakedAerodromeAM._stakeAndClaim()   #1

88         function _stakeAndClaim(address asset, uint256 amount) internal override {
89             address gauge = assetToGauge[asset];
90     
91             // Claim rewards
92             IAeroGauge(gauge).getReward(address(this));
93     
94             // Stake asset
95  @>         ERC20(asset).approve(gauge, amount);
96             IAeroGauge(gauge).deposit(amount);
97:        }

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Use OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20`'s `safeApprove()` instead of direct calls to `approve()`
