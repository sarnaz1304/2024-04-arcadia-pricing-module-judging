# Reward Handling Vulnerability

## Summary
Potential for Reward Manipulation Due to Unsynchronized Reward State

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract claims rewards from an external gauge (**IAeroGauge**) which might introduce a risk if the reward state is unsynchronized or manipulated. This is seen in the methods that interact with the **getReward** function of the **IAeroGauge** without verifying or locking the amount of rewards due before executing the transaction. This could potentially lead to issues if the rewards are not calculated and disbursed correctly, or if there are changes in the external contractâ€™s state between the reward calculation and claim.


## Impact
An attacker, potentially even a miner or someone capable of influencing transaction order, could manipulate the reward claiming process. They might, for example, front-run a legitimate reward claim with another transaction that alters the state of the gauge (such as changing reward distribution or staking additional assets), thus affecting the amount of rewards due. This could result in the legitimate user receiving fewer rewards than expected.

code precision 

```solidity
function _claimReward(address asset) internal override {
    IAeroGauge(assetToGauge[asset]).getReward(address(this));
}

function _getCurrentReward(address asset) internal view override returns (uint256 currentReward) {
    currentReward = IAeroGauge(assetToGauge[asset]).earned(address(this));
}
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability:

1. **Lock-In Reward Amounts**: Implement a mechanism to lock in the reward amount before claiming it. This could involve a two-step process where the reward amount is first confirmed and then claimed in a separate transaction, reducing the risk of state changes affecting the reward amount.
2. **Atomic Operations:** If feasible, combine the reward amount calculation and the claiming process into a single atomic operation to ensure that the reward amount calculated is exactly what is claimed.
3. **Event Monitoring:** Implement event monitoring for changes in the reward state or gauge configuration changes. This could help in tracking unexpected changes and responding quickly.
4. **Use of Oracles or Additional Checks**: Consider using trusted oracles or additional checks within the contract to verify the correctness of the reward amount based on external conditions or states.

**Further Considerations**
In addition to the recommendations, ensure that there are clear and transparent mechanisms for users to verify the accuracy of their rewards and to report discrepancies. Regular audits and monitoring of the external gauge and voter contracts are also critical to ensure that any potential vulnerabilities or changes that could impact the reward mechanism are identified and mitigated promptly.
