# Lack of Access Control on Sensitive Functions

## Summary
Sensitive functions such as **mint**, **increaseLiquidity**, and **setBaseURI** are unprotected against unauthorized access, potentially allowing any user to execute these functions without restrictions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract does not implement role-based access controls (e.g., OpenZeppelin's **Ownable** or **AccessControl**) for functions that can affect the contract's operational integrity and asset security.

## Impact
Unauthorized users could potentially mint new tokens, alter liquidity, or change operational parameters, leading to asset manipulation or unintended access to contract management.

Precision

```solidity
function mint(address pool, uint128 amount) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 positionId) {
    // Function body
}

function setBaseURI(string calldata newBaseURI) external onlyOwner {
    baseURI = newBaseURI;
}
```
The **onlyOwner** modifier is mentioned in **setBaseURI** but not used in **mint** or **increaseLiquidity**, indicating inconsistent access control application.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a consistent access control strategy using OpenZeppelin's **AccessControl** to manage permissions across all sensitive functions. Define roles for operations like minting and liquidity management to ensure that only authorized addresses can perform these actions.

**Further Considerations**

- **Event Emission after State Changes:** Ensure that all state changes are followed by corresponding event emissions for transparency and traceability.
- **Error Messages:** Standardize and provide clear error messages for all revert conditions to improve debugging and user interaction.
- **Gas Optimization:** Review and optimize gas usage, particularly in loops and state-changing operations, to minimize transaction costs.
- **Upgradeability**: Consider an upgradeable contract design using proxies to allow for future improvements without losing state or having to deploy a new contract.
- This audit outlines key areas for improvement to enhance security, maintainability, and functionality of the **WrappedAerodromeAM** contract. Implementing these recommendations would help safeguard against common vulnerabilities and ensure that the contract operates securely as intended.
