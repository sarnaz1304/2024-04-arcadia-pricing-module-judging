# Lack of Access Control for addAsset

## Summary

Insufficient Access Control for Stable Pools Addition in **addAsset** Function

## Vulnerability Detail

The **addAsset** function is intended to add new Aerodrome pools to the module. It contains a specific condition that only allows the contract owner to add stable pools. However, the restriction is applied after other significant state changes have occurred, which can potentially lead to unintended side effects or manipulation opportunities before the ownership check fails.


## Impact

An unauthorized user (non-owner) could initiate the addition of a stable pool, causing the function to execute several state-changing operations before failing at the ownership check. This could lead to unexpected contract states or denial of service where legitimate operations are blocked or fail due to altered state.


## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-arcadia-pricing-module/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/asset-modules/Aerodrome-Finance/AerodromePoolAM.sol#L76-L93


```solidity
function addAsset(address pool) external {
    if (AERO_FACTORY.isPool(pool) != true) revert InvalidPool();

    (address token0, address token1) = IAeroPool(pool).tokens();
    if (!IRegistry(REGISTRY).isAllowed(token0, 0)) revert AssetNotAllowed();
    if (!IRegistry(REGISTRY).isAllowed(token1, 0)) revert AssetNotAllowed();

    if (IAeroPool(pool).stable()) {
        // Only owner can add Stable pools
        if (msg.sender != owner) revert OnlyOwner();
        
        // ... additional code ...
    }

    // ... additional code ...
}
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Restructure the function to perform the ownership check at the beginning of the function for stable pools before any other logic is processed. This ensures that only authorized users can trigger state changes related to stable pool additions.
