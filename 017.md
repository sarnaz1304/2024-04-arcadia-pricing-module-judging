# Donating (and syncing) tokens to an Aerodrome allows to bypass exposure limits

## Summary
An attacker can bypass the exposure limits by donating tokens to an Aerodrome pool in which he owns ~100% of the liquidity, this will inflate reserves which will increase the value of the collateral and the attacker won't lose capital because he owns ~100% of the liquidity.

## Vulnerability Detail
Attack scenario:
1. Create a new Aerodrome pool, let's suppose an STG/WETH pool
2. Provide liquidity to the pool and mint LPs, let's suppose we mint ~1000$ worth of liquidity
3. Deposit the LP in an Arcadia account, the collateral is worth ~1000$
4. Send STG and WETH directly to the Aerodrome pool, let's suppose we send ~500_000$ worth of tokens
5. Call [sync()](https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/contracts/blob/main/contracts/Pool.sol#L397-L399) on the Aerodrome pool
6. The pool reserves are increased and the collateral is now worth ~501_000$

By doing this an attacker can bypass exposure limits. Note that Arcadia allows the use of any volatile Aerodrome pool LPs as collateral, as long as the underlying tokens are allowed.

## Impact
An attacker can bypass the exposure limits set by a creditor.
