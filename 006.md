# Unverified External Contract Dependencies

## Summary
Potential Security Risks Due to Unverified External Contract Dependencies

## Vulnerability Detail
The StakedAerodromeAM contract relies heavily on external contracts (**IAeroGauge** and **IAeroVoter**) for its core functionalities, including verifying gauges, staking tokens, claiming rewards, and withdrawing stakes. The contract assumes these external contracts are secure and operate correctly. However, if these contracts are compromised, have vulnerabilities, or their behavior changes (e.g., due to an upgrade), it can adversely affect the **StakedAerodromeAM** contract.

## Impact
If an external contract such as **IAeroGauge** or **IAeroVoter** is compromised or behaves unexpectedly:

- The staking mechanism might stake more tokens than intended or stake in incorrect pools.
- Reward claiming could lead to loss of tokens or claiming less than the correct amount.
- Withdrawals might not return the correct amount of tokens or might interact with malicious contracts.
- Token approvals to malicious addresses could lead to unauthorized access to fund transfers.
- This would not only disrupt the contract's intended operations but could also lead to financial losses for users and damage the trust in the system's security.

```solidity
function addAsset(address gauge) external {
    if (AERO_VOTER.isGauge(gauge) != true) revert GaugeNotValid();
    ...
    IAeroGauge(gauge).deposit(amount);
}
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the risks associated with external dependencies, consider implementing the following safeguards:

1. **Contract Address Verification**: Ensure that the addresses for IAeroGauge and IAeroVoter are verified and come from a trusted source. This can be managed through a governance process or an admin function that allows for updating these addresses only under strict conditions.
2. **Interface Integrity Checks:** Implement interface checks to ensure that the external contracts conform to expected interfaces. This can be done using EIP-165 standard interface detection.
3. **Handling Upgrades and Changes**: Set up a monitoring system or use contract events to notify administrators of changes in the external contracts' behaviors or in case of upgrades.
4. **Circuit Breaker:** Implement a circuit breaker mechanism that can pause certain functionalities of the contract if anomalies or unexpected behaviors are detected in the external dependencies.
5. **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and checks on the external contracts, especially after any updates or changes to their code.

**Further Considerations**
Incorporating robust checks and balances for managing interactions with external contracts is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of the system. Additionally, consider establishing emergency response strategies to address potential issues when they are detected in external dependencies. This proactive approach helps in minimizing impact and resolving issues swiftly.
