# Unsafe Approval Pattern

## Summary
Potential for ERC20 approve/transferFrom Race Conditions

## Vulnerability Detail
The **_stakeAndClaim** function uses the **approve** method of the ERC20 token to set an allowance for the **gauge** to spend tokens. This allowance is set every time the function is called without first resetting it to zero. The ERC20 standard's **approve** function can be vulnerable to a front-running attack if the allowance is not first set to zero—especially in public or external functions that might be called repeatedly in a transactional context.
## Impact
An attacker could exploit the race condition by front-running a transaction that aims to set a new allowance with a call that uses the old allowance. This could lead to unexpected behavior such as unauthorized token transfers if the attacker can manipulate transaction order (e.g., through a miner or by being a miner themselves).

```solidity
function _stakeAndClaim(address asset, uint256 amount) internal override {
    address gauge = assetToGauge[asset];
    ERC20(asset).approve(gauge, amount);  // Unsafe approval pattern
    IAeroGauge(gauge).deposit(amount);
}
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, consider adopting the “safe approval” pattern. This involves resetting the token allowance to zero before setting it to a new amount, especially if the allowance may not be entirely used up in one transaction. This pattern helps protect against the mentioned race conditions.
Here's how the function could be adjusted:

```solidity
function _stakeAndClaim(address asset, uint256 amount) internal override {
    address gauge = assetToGauge[asset];
    
    // Safely resetting allowance to zero first
    ERC20 token = ERC20(asset);
    uint256 currentAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), gauge);
    if (currentAllowance > 0) {
        token.approve(gauge, 0);
    }
    token.approve(gauge, amount);
    
    IAeroGauge(gauge).deposit(amount);
}
```
**Other consideration**
Ensure that all functions modifying state or interacting with external contracts are well-guarded against reentrancy and follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern. Moreover, while the above fix mitigates the immediate concern with the approve method, it's essential to review and test all contract interactions involving ERC20 tokens to ensure that similar issues do not occur elsewhere in the contract.

This recommendation does not only secure the contract against the specific vulnerability but also aligns it with best practices for handling token allowances in a secure and predictable manner.
