# WrappedAerodromeAM.sol is not compatible with the Revert on Zero Value Tokens

## Summary
From the README file:
We also want to receive issues regarding minimal implementations of ERC20 Tokens, which besides a standard implementation have one of the following "weird behaviours": `Revert on Zero Value`.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the owner of a position calls `WrappedAerodromeAM.decreaseLiquidity`, they should receive the transferred liquidity back and fees.

Let's consider the following scenario:

1)The owner of the position calls `decreaseLiquidity`, and they are supposed to receive fees.
```solidity
        // Claim any pending fees from the Aerodrome Pool.
        (uint256 fee0Pool, uint256 fee1Pool) = _claimFees(pool);

        // Calculate the new fee balances.
        (poolState_, positionState_) = _getFeeBalances(poolState_, positionState_, fee0Pool, fee1Pool);
```
2)Since the fee for the `revert on zero transfer token` is zero, a DOS will occur, and the user will not be able to decrease liquidity.
```solidity
        // Pay out the fees to the position owner.
        ERC20(token0[pool]).safeTransfer(msg.sender, fee0Position);  //fee0Position = 0
        ERC20(token1[pool]).safeTransfer(msg.sender, fee1Position); // or fee1Position = 0
        emit FeesPaid(positionId, uint128(fee0Position), uint128(fee1Position));
```

## Impact
A denial-of-service (DOS) can occur on the `decreaseLiquidity` and `claimFees` functions in `WrappedAerodromeAM` smart contract of the revert on zero transfer token when the fee is zero value.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider changing `decreaseLiquidity` and `claimFees` functions as follows:
```diff
+ if (fee0Position != 0)
            ERC20(token0[pool]).safeTransfer(msg.sender, fee0Position);
+ if (fee1Position != 0)
            ERC20(token1[pool]).safeTransfer(msg.sender, fee1Position);
```
