# Improper Ordering of Checks and State Changes

## Summary
State Changes Prior to Completing Validation Checks

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract allows for state changes by setting mappings and updating asset states before all necessary validations are completed. Specifically, in the **addAsset** function, the contract first checks whether a gauge is valid and whether the pool is allowed by the registry. However, the check for the reward token match occurs after these changes. This means there's a window where the state is modified before it's fully validated, potentially allowing inconsistencies to be introduced if the subsequent checks fail.


## Impact
If the reward token check fails after state modifications are made, the contract's state could become inconsistent. For example, an asset could be marked as allowed or registered in mappings with a gauge that doesn't eventually get fully approved because of the failing reward token check. This could lead to unclear contract states or enable an attacker to exploit these inconsistencies, potentially causing disruptions in staking operations or incorrect configurations that could be leveraged in other attacks.

more precision

```solidity
function addAsset(address gauge) external {
    if (AERO_VOTER.isGauge(gauge) != true) revert GaugeNotValid();

    address pool = IAeroGauge(gauge).stakingToken();
    if (!IRegistry(REGISTRY).isAllowed(pool, 0)) revert PoolNotAllowed();
    if (assetState[pool].allowed) revert AssetAlreadySet();

    assetToGauge[pool] = gauge; // State change occurs here
    _addAsset(pool); // Further state changes

    if (IAeroGauge(gauge).rewardToken() != address(REWARD_TOKEN)) revert RewardTokenNotValid(); // Validation occurs after state changes
}

```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Reorder the function to ensure all validations are completed before any state changes are made. This adheres to the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern, which is a best practice in smart contract development to prevent such issues. Here's how the function could be adjusted:

```solidity

function addAsset(address gauge) external {
    if (AERO_VOTER.isGauge(gauge) != true) revert GaugeNotValid();

    address pool = IAeroGauge(gauge).stakingToken();
    if (!IRegistry(REGISTRY).isAllowed(pool, 0)) revert PoolNotAllowed();
    if (assetState[pool].allowed) revert AssetAlreadySet();
    if (IAeroGauge(gauge).rewardToken() != address(REWARD_TOKEN)) revert RewardTokenNotValid(); // Move validation up

    assetToGauge[pool] = gauge; // Now safe to change state
    _addAsset(pool);
}

```
**Further Considerations**
Ensuring that all validation checks are completed before modifying the state can help avoid inconsistencies and potential vulnerabilities. Regular audits and adherence to smart contract development best practices are crucial to maintain the security and robustness of the contract.
